November 5th, 2014 - Week 1

Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience?
  The DBC experience seems to be awesome, I am so pumped that a group of people have considered me capable to learn a new skill in such short amount of time. The video really put some of my expectations into perspective, and clarified some confusions, it was worth the time to watch. I know now I have to come in ready to give this program my all, and work really hard to make this experience my own and the best it can be.

What is your impression of DBC?
  It seems like a great place for beginners in software development. In terms of culture it seems like a humble environment of people that are hungry to both learn and teach. It's also a place for people that take chances and are willing to take a leap of faith into a new career and work on making DBC the best it can be. DBC is a work in progress and going back to the restaurant vs. kitchen midset, it's definitely a kitchen mindset.

How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
I see myself engaging in this environment really well. I was really worried about the value of naturally intelligence in this program, and now I understand that it is more about emotional intelligence. Which puts me at ease because I have the I don't know but lets figure it out together mentality. I'm ready to walk in with an open heart, go kick some behind, get social, and make real connections with people.

Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how?
  Yes. My expectations have changed in terms of the process after the program. I was thinking that as long as I do the program, I will get a job. However, that mentality has now been shifted because I will only get out what I put in. Also I have to keep in mind that I won't get the first job I apply to right away because it's hard to find a job out of bootcamp when I'm competing with people who have professional degrees in the same field. I shouldn't take comfort in the numbers, which I was doing.

Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment?
  YES! I am so excited to hit the ground running and really give my all to learning in an environment of people as hungry as I am.

Does it make you nervous?
  Yes, I have so many fears, fears that make me nervous. I doubt my ability to be able to finish such a fast-paced program with people who may have much more experience than me. So what I do to overcome this is just do the work! I will never know if I don't try, and I am ready to work with all my stregth to become good at programming. I hope that by embracing my fears and nerves I will rise to another level.
