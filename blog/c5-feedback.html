Pairing:
<br>
<br>
It's been so much fun to do pairing session for coding challenges. Itâ€™s like you have a group of people all working on solving the same problem and each one views the solution with a different perspective. The best part for me is learning about those perspectives and hearing new ways to approaching a problem. I learn so much from hearing others thought process and it's usually things I would've never thought to do on my own. I realized that once you begin a code you go down the path of doing it one way, when you pair the person usually brings in another path and you grow a new set of eyes for it. The most rewarding part of pairing is when you solve the problem and come up with a working solution together. It feels like you are superman on top of the world, and kind of just saved the planet. Ok, maybe that's a bit exaggerated but not that far off. Like most things in life there are also some frustrations that come with pairing, and for me it's a person knowledge level. If you pair with someone at your level you will get a lot more out of it, you will research and discover things together which is super rewarding. However, when pairs are on different levels one usually ends up teaching the other and in that scenario one is usually getting more out of it than the other. Another difficult part of pairing for me personally, is the required conversation when solving a challenge. I am used to thinking about a problem, researching information, and then pseudocoding through the solution. However most people like to talk about the solution right away and get to the code ASAP, which doesn't give me much time to think it through. So help this difficulty I usually prepare beforehand and have the logic down before pairing.

Feedback
<br>
<br>
Being vulnerable when learning something is both enormously rewarding and very intimidating. You are going to mess up, do great, and maybe be completely lost at times. All this comes out in pairing sessions and especially feedback. For the most part people provide Actionable, Specific, and Kind (ASK) feedback. The actionable part for me is the most useful because it's usually the part that contains constructive feedback that you can actively improve on. It doesn't feel super great to hear things you need to work, but its like medicine, you don't want to take it but its good for you. The feedback is really helpful to my learning because it helped me pick up on the small things that I didn't even know were a "thing." For example one person said "I would like to hear your thought process as you write code, rather than after you are done writing it." After about four pieces of feedback on communication related things I saw the trend and was able to pinpoint my areas of improvement. Based on this feedback I now ask my pairing partners about their style of working and communication before we start and its made a world of a difference.

Now, when you are the one writing the feedback, the pressure is on. You have to be concise and really reflect on the experience. I usually give my pair feedback later on during that same day, this way it's fresh in my mind but still gives me enough time to reflect on it. The most difficult part about giving feedback is being honest and constructive. As nice human beings we just want to highlight all the great things in people, but denying them of constructive feedback would be unfair.
I am convinced that pairing and feedback is an essential part to learning and become a great developer. In fact, I would dare to say that without pairing and collaboration you can't be a true expert. You alone, on planet developer population 1 will never know all the answers, or have all the insights, or develop every possible debugger, its just not possible. So I think new developers should read code together and pair often. It makes coding a lot more fun. </p>
