      So at Dev Bootcamp Pair Programming is something that is done often, about three times a week. Basically, you are working with another student on solving weekly challenges together. There are rules and roles to this. One person should be the navigator, meaning that you lead and guide the session by reading the instructions and sharing ideas. The other person is the driver, they are to actually type out the code for the solution and test it along the way.Throughout the session the two can switch which is done in most cases. There are a lot of tools used to share code and program in pairs some include <a href="http://repl.it/languages">Repl.it</a>, <a href="https://code.stypi.com/">Stypi</a>, or simply <a href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/">Google Hangouts</a>. The rules for giving feedback are quite simple: be kind, actionable, and specific.

    <h2>
      Pairing
    </h2>
    <p>
      <b>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</b>
      It's really cool to work in pairs when solving challenges. For one it forces you to interact with other people and escape your solo coding world. It's great to hear their experiences and you'd be surprised how many things you have in common with somone you've never met. Personally, it reminds me that I am not alone on this journey, and we are all working really hard to learn this stuff. I couldn't imagine going through this program without pairing. It would actually be unfair if Dev Bootcamp didn't allow or encourage pair programming becuase in the "real world" most programmers work in teams. This in fact helps us to learn those social skills that we will use later.

      <b>Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</b>
      It's really fun when you get to see different coding styles, you are exposed to learn new perspectives. It challenges you to come out of your own logic and try to understand the someone elses. This really is a great way to learn how to solve problems in multiple ways. Whether you are at the same level or not of the person you are working with, there is always learning happening, either as a teacher as you explain concepts or as a student when the other person is guiding you. We learn to express ourselves better in a new language. Literally, you are speaking Ruby, HTML, CSS, or Javascript to another person and have to make sure your ideas or thoughts are getting across. This improves on our communication skills altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</b>
      Technical difficulties can be frustrating and distracting at times. We do most of our work in google hangouts having to share screens, text, video feed, and audio all at once. When something gives out it really impedes on the learning experience. Besides this I find it difficult sometimes to work with someone who isn't prepared or is really falling behind on the work. You end up having to hold their hand through the process, and while that is good learning, it puts all the responsibility of getting the solution on you. It's really best case scenario in my opinion when both people are on the same level and can both add value to the session.

     <h2>Feedback
     </h2>

    <p>
      <b>How did you feel when you read your feedback?</b>
      I felt happy, sad, super sad, and excited all within 5 mins in that order. Honestly, it's shocking to read some of the constructive feedback given, most of which I was never aware of in the first place. I guess it's a good thing that we are eventually given the feedback because it helps us grow and get better. However, like medicine it doesn't feel great at the moment, but in the long run its for our benefit. I sometimes wish people would give me the feedback during the session so that they don't have to suffer through it. I understand though that some people are shy or just don't feel comfortable doing that, so it's great that DBC encourages anonymous feedback.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</b>
      I think the most helpful pieces of feedback I received were very specific. I was told I should be more outspoken and voice out my ideas. I was also advised on being more careful in how I word things, I am very direct by nature and it didn't come off as being kind. Finally, I was told to be aware of my surroundings. I usually work out of my kitchen table because it's the only table I have and the noise from my mom cooking in the background was distracting.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</b>
      I have taken all this feedback and made the appropriate changes. I ask a lot of questions and make sure to say my ideas as we go. I have changed my working place to my room and bought a desk. Also, I am trying to phrase my words in a nicer tone using phrases like "That's a great idea we should try it, and what do you think about this" rather than "Let's do this instead". It has really improved the quality of my sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>How was it to write feedback?</b>
      At first it seems repetitive because there is only so much feedback you can provide person, before you start saying the same thing to everyone. It feels like giving constructive feedback is almost easier than coming up with "you did great" feedback. As humans I think we are naturally inclined to see the faults in things, than to notice the good. Nonetheless, it is awesome that we get to share our feedback with each other and that it's multi-dimensional feedback. At DBC everyone rates all the feedback in a thing called the "Feedbackinator". This assures that the feedback is keeping within the guidelines and is appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</b>
      It's hard for me to give constructive feedback. I never want to discourage someone, or call them out for something. So I have to differentiate negative feedback from constructive and be intentional about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?</b>
      I think its necessary and highly motivating. It opens up a whole other world of knowledge and self-awareness that is needed to grow. I would encourage every programmer to make it a habit, even if it's just to have your code reviewed or refactored.
