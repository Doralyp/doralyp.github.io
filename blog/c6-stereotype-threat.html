    <h2>Defenition </h2>
    <p>
      This week I am blogging about <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html">stereotype threat</a>. What is that you ask? It basically refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group. Steele’s theory starts with the concept of social identity, which he defined as group membership in categories such as age, gender, religion and ethnicity. Though it sounds like theory, it is real, very real. As a matter of fact I’m sure you’ve experienced it at some point in your life and have awkwardly tried to get out of the situation. I know for me it has happened often, and as I go into the developer world dominated by men, it will probably continue to happen. So if it’s real, and it effects us, then the most logical thing to do is to learn about it and figure out ways to overcome it. I’m hopeful that eventually, it will be a thing of the past.
    </p>
    <h2>Effects </h2>
    <p>
      Being reduced to a stereotype is never a good feeling, it also doesn’t produce good outcomes. Results show that performance in academic contexts can be harmed by the awareness that one's behavior might be viewed through the lens of racial stereotypes. If you are the only Asian in a math class, everyone expects you to be great because of your race, but we all know this is illogical yet we all do it. Consistent exposure to stereotype threat (i.e., faced by some ethnic minorities in academic environments and women in math) can reduce the degree that individuals value the domain in question. In other words, you won’t want to pursue computer science for example, because women are stereotyped as not smart enough or equal to men in that field. Why would you put yourself in a position to fail? You wouldn’t, so instead you choose something else. Furthermore, stereotype threat has been shown to affect stereotyped individuals’ performance in a number of domains beyond academics, such as white men in sports, women in negotiation, homosexual men in providing childcare, and women in driving amongst other things.

    <h2>Subconscious Self-Handicapping</h2>
    <p>
      Research has shown that stereotype threat can harm the academic performance of any individual for whom the situation invokes a stereotype-based expectation of poor performance. For example, stereotype threat has been shown to harm the academic performance of Hispanics, students from low socioeconomic backgrounds, females in math. When one views oneself in terms of a salient group membership (e.g., "I am a woman, women are not expected to be good at math, and this is a difficult math test"), performance can be undermined because of concerns about possibly confirming negative stereotypes about one's group. Thus, situations that increase the salience of the stereotyped group identity can increase vulnerability to stereotype threat.

    <h2>My Experience</h2>
    <p>
      “If you care about what you are doing, the prospect of being judged is upsetting and distressing and disturbing,” says Steele. I personally am a bit terrified because, I fit all the stereotype categories mentioned above. I am a Hispanic (Dominican), from a very low socioeconomic background, and a woman in tech. I also care a lot about what I am doing and face stereotype threat on a daily basis. At work there are 80 engineers of which 5 are females, and I am also the only Latina there. My environment reminds me that I am the exception to the rule, and that it is “not normal” for me to be there. It is a huge pressure break away from the stereotype, but even more to feel comfortable and welcomed in that environment. Before people even speak to me they have all these preconceptions of what I must be like mostly gathered from stereotypes, and it is my job to break those down. It’s also nothing new, I went to a predominately white university and was believed to be black just because I am of color. The idea of being judged is very distressing when the judgement is negative, I very much agree with Steele.
    </p>
    <h2>Hope</h2>
    <p>
      I hope that increasing understanding of the phenomenon may reduce its occurrence and impact. “It’s one thing to numerically integrate a setting. It’s another thing to make that place a place where everyone feels comfortable and can flourish.” Overcoming stereotype threats is key to removing barriers to achievement that currently hinder Blacks, women and other underrepresented groups in school and the workplace. How do we change this? I think a big part of it is raising awareness, and reshaping the situations or circumstances that lead to it. We have to educate people on both sides and work together to eliminate it.  No one should have to ever experience stereotype threat mentally or physically, but we have a lot of work to do if we want that day to arrive.
