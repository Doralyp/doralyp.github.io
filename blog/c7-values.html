      Summary</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Last week I learned about Stereotype Threat. One of the antidotes identified by Claude M. Steele in his book is affirmation. In this blog I identify values that are important to me and consider how my values may help combat Stereotype Threat at Dev Bootcamp.

    <b>
      Accomplishment</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      This value is important to me for various reasons. I think I owe it to my family to succeed and accomplish great things because they sacrificed a lot and worked really hard to give me the opportunities and life I have today. I also think that accomplishments in life lead to growth and success. I don’t remember a single time in my life where I wasn’t working to accomplish something.

    <b>
      What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on? Did it relate to any of the values you found important?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes. I often help my friends and family with school applications, programs, and scholarships. I guess that ties into accomplishment, growth, and meaningful work. I’ve been able to do a lot and receive aid when I needed it. This makes me an “expert” on the topic according to them, and I always help anyway I can. I do a lot of mentoring as a consequence of this.

    <b>
      How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it? </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m not certain that my values can mediate stereotype threat, I’m not sure how to use them in that sense. However, I understand my values very clearly and they ground me whenever I start to question or doubt myself.
    </p>

    <b>
      Can you think of any other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?  </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Remembering past accomplishments is usually a big motivator for me, it reminds me that if I did it before I can do it again. I also carry a picture of my parents in my wallet that I look at and it reminds me of my purpose, of my ultimate mission. It doesn’t allow me to give up. When I am down I usually call my fiancé and he encourages me to never compare myself to others, and to keep pushing because no one was born knowing, everyone had to learn and I can too. Prayer is also something I do often and daily. My spiritual life and faith keep me strong in hardest of times, it gives me supernatural hope. I think these are all things I can do and are very practical in nature.
