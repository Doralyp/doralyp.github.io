      Option 1. OO vs. Functional Programming

      So you've had some experience with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) this week. Some consider Functional programming the opposite of OO - compare them.

      Option 2: Variable Scope

      What kinds of variables does Ruby support? Where are they accessible? When would you use them and what makes them different?

      Option 3: Class Methods

      Research class methods and desribe what they are, how to use them, and when you would use them.

      Option 4: Blocs, Procs, and Lambdas

      What are these? How do they work? Procs and Lambdas are very rarely used at your stage of learning, but they are good to learn about. You should try to be comfortable with blocs by the end of Phase 0.

      Option 5: Classes vs Modules

      Describe and explain the purposes of classes and modules. How are they similar? How do they compare?

      Option 6: Inheritance vs Composition

      What is Ruby inheritance? What is composition? Which have you used this week? Create your own examples to explain how to use each. See the BONUS challenges for another challenge that addresses these concepts.
