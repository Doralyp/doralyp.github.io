      Have you ever posted on the Google+ community, or Stack Overflow and didn't get the answer you needed? Were you frustrated by not receiving a helpful response? Did you review the question and consider why people weren't answering? Did you not give enough information? Was the question asked elsewhere? Was it unclear? Learning how to ask good questions is a necessary skill for success as a developer and a student. So let’s go over some tips on how to ask good questions.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Tips:</b>
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Make an interesting title, keep it simple, specific, and get to the point. No one has time to figure out what you are trying to say, they are already giving their time trying to help, so don’t make it harder than it should be. </li>
      <li>Summarize the problem, don’t go over a sentence in length. Be precise and informative.</li>
      <li>Research and share what you have found so far. This shows that you aren’t duplicating questions or simply being lazy.</li>
      <li>Share unusual circumstances that make your question different from similar questions already online.</li>
      <li>Include just enough code to allow others to reproduce the problem.</li>
      <li>Include all the relevant tags, this makes searching and getting responses quicker and more accurate.</li>
      <li>Proof-read before posting. Make sure the title matches the question. Use capital letters when appropriate for easier reading and always look for typos.</li>
      <li>Ask and respond to feedback. Say thank you to all who respond, everyone appreciates a little courtesy.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
