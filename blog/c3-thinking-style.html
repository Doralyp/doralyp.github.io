    It is a miracle, but I have made it through three weeks (Phase 0) of Dev Bootcamp. I am officially on my way to being a great Web Developer, it's a bit unreal (pinch me). This week I am reflecting on my thinking style and considering how understanding this style will be an advantage at DBC to help my learning.
    <br>
    <br>
    When looking at Anthony Gregorc's analysis of <a href= http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm>Mind Styles Model</a>, I have come to the conclusion that I am a concrete sequential. I fit mostly all of its descriptions with the exception that I don't struggle to work in groups, furthermore I actually thrive in group environments. I guess this explains why I joined a program like DBC, becuase it gives me a structure to learn with group work as its core.
    <br>
    <br>
    So far my biggest struggle in Phase 0 has been the CSS portion and keeping up with the workload in general. It feels like I've been drinking from a digital firehose. I assumed that there was one way to do things in code, but to my surprise this couldn't be any more wrong! There's a million ways to do everything, and the fun part is you get to figure it out. I was honestly overwhelmed. Being the concrete sequential that I am, I referred to my textbooks and guides and couldn't find the answers I needed to solve the weekly challenges. I was looking to work by myself, in a routine sequential order, expecting everything to be black and white. After hours of pulling my hair out I realized I was doing it all wrong. I turned to my accountability group, my cohort, I attended office hours, and was able to find the resources I needed.

    I will make sure to change my style of learning and sourcing going forward. I also need to be more comfortable asking for help and realizing that I won't know it all, so I should use good ol' Google for help. Part of knowing about your thinking style is to know what you need to learn effectively, but we should also broaden the ways we learn and think. This is where the idea of growth vs. fixed mindset comes in. Our learning and thinking styles can morph and change as we exercise our brains. So to do just this I plan to try new ways to learn. Things like doing more one on one pairing sessions, read unofficial guides online, and do classes like codecademy and code school to supplement my learning. I also want to do more tinkering, and hands on creatios through code, so I can learn as I go. The only challenge will be time, and that's something I am continiously working on.
