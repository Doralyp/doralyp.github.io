      Enumerables:

      Break a collection into groups based on some given criteria.

      input: A block containing the criteria by which the items in the collection will be grouped.

      output: A hash where each key represents a group. Each key’s corresponding value is an array containing the members of that group.
    </p>
    <p>

      When used on an array, group_by iterates through the array, passing each element to to the block. The result value of the block is the group into which the element will be placed.

      The Enumerable mixin provides collection classes with several traversal and searching methods, and with the ability to sort.

      If Enumerable#max, #min, or #sort is used, the objects in the collection must also implement a meaningful <=> operator, as these methods rely on an ordering between members of the collection.

    </p>
    <p>
      Groups the collection by result of the block. Returns a hash where the keys are the evaluated result from the block and the values are arrays of elements in the collection that correspond to the key.
      If no block is given an enumerator is returned.

      group_by {| obj | block } → a_hash

      group_by → an_enumerator
      (1..6).group_by {|i| i%3}   #=> {0=>[3, 6], 1=>[1, 4], 2=>[2, 5]}

      Returns a hash, which keys are evaluated result from the block, and values are arrays of elements in enum corresponding to the key.
      If no block is given, an enumerator is returned instead.

      cats = ["Tiger", "Lion", "Puma", "Leopard", "Jaguar",
              "Cheetah", "Bobcat"]
      grouped_by_length = cats.group_by { |cat| cat.length }
       
      #{5=>["Tiger"], 4=>["Lion", "Puma"], 7=>["Leopard", "Cheetah"], 6=>["Jaguar", "Bobcat"]}

      birds = ["Golden Eagle", "Gyrfalcon", "American Robin",

      grouped_by_first_letter = birds.group_by { |s| s[0] }
       
      # {"G"=>["Golden Eagle", "Gyrfalcon"], "A"=>["American Robin"],
      # "M"=>["Mountain BlueBird", "Mountain-Hawk Eagle"]}

      No matter what language you use, learn as much about the available collections in the standard library (or available open source packages) as possible because this will save you a lot of time when using those languages.

    <p>
      Enumerable#group_by and Hashes
      When used on a hash, group_by passes each key/value pair in the hash to the block, which you can “catch” as either:
      1. A two-element array, with the key as element 0 and its corresponding value as element 1, or 2. Two separate items, with the key as the first item and its corresponding value as the second item.
    </p>
