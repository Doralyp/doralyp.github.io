    <p>The Tech Industry, how beautiful and great it is. Many forget it's just a baby, a few years ago it literally didn't exist. As you can imagine this raises a lot of issues or opportunities depending how you view things (half empty, half full kind of thing). We have only tasted the possibilities of technology, just a few years ago we landed on the moon and a few days ago on a comet. Technology and its impact on the world is something we are just now beginning to explore. Technology and its industry really impacts every industry, everything is somehow digitally connected and that's a great thing.

    However, this background reminds us that there are still a lot of things to learn and improve on. See there are a lot of issues in Tech that other industries have already resolved, like the amount of women in the field for example. Not to long ago the marketing industry was mostly men and today it is almost the opposite. We are seeing the next wave of this in Tech, where companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter are being challenged in their numbers of female engineers. We all know of this problem because it is the "hot topic"of the day with things like #FeministHackerBarbie blowing up on Twitter. Don't get me wrong this is all great, but I think the bigger issues lies in inequality in the workplace. The tech industry, especially startups are mostly made up of white males. This could be due to a number of factors but if tech is going to make the changes it needs to in the future, it has to include diversity and equality. </p>
