        <h3>What is pair programming?</h3>
        <p>
            Pair programming is when two people work together as a team.
            They usually decide how they want to work together in terms of driving and navigating.
        </p>
        <h3>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h3>
        <p>
            Because one person doesn't know all the answers and it's good to work as a team.
            As a navigator, it helps to cement your learnings by teaching it to someone else,
            and as driver you can learn how other people think through things, and it teaches you patience.
            It prepares you for the workplace in that you learn how to work in a team.
        </p>
        <h3>Compare driver and navigator.</h3>
        <p>
            The driver is the person who is hands on with the programming,
            while the navigator acts as a guide.
        </p>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            What was it like to pair for the first time? Did you enjoy it? This was my second pair session and it was good, I enjoyed it. Made the work go a lot faster, and it helped me think through a fresh set of eyes. I got to hear her perspective and opinions on how to do things more effectively.

            What worked? What didn't work?
            We worked well together, we were able to create the wireframe we designed in the time of the pairing session. We got all the work done, it was great. We weren't use to doing the css inline with the html so that was a bit weird, and had to ask for guidance which is where we found the style tag that we had long forgotten about.
