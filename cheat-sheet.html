  <h2>Looping in Ruby vs. JavaScript</h2>

  <div id="ruby">
    <ol>
      <li>The for loop consists of for followed by a variable to contain the iteration argument followed by in and the value to iterate over using each. The do is optional.
      </li>
      <img src = "rubyfor.png">
      <li>The while loop executes while a condition is true.</li>
      <img src = "rubywhile.png">
      <li>The until loop executes while a condition is false.</li>
      <img src = "rubyuntil.png">
      <li>Calls the given block once for each element in self, passing that element as a parameter.</li>
      <img src = "rubyeach.png">
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div id="js">
    <ol>
      <li>The for statement creates a loop that consists of three optional expressions, enclosed in parentheses and separated by semicolons, followed by a statement executed in the loop.</li>
      <img src = "jsfor.png">
      <li>The while statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long as the test condition evaluates to true. The condition is evaluated before executing the statement.</li>
      <img src = "jswhile.png">
      <li>The do...while statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement until the test condition evaluates to false. The condition is evaluated after executing the statement, resulting in the specified statement executing at least once.</li>
      <img src = "jsdowhile.png">
      <li>The for..in statement iterates over the enumerable properties of an object, in arbitrary order. For each distinct property, statements can be executed.</li>
